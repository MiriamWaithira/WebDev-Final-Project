# Project Summary: FarmLink
Overview: FarmLink is a web application designed to facilitate the buying and selling of agricultural products and services. The platform connects farmers, sellers, and buyers, creating a seamless marketplace where users can register, list items for sale, and browse available listings. The main objective of FarmLink is to enhance agricultural trade by providing a user-friendly interface that connects producers and consumers efficiently.

Logic and Functionality:
1. User Registration and Login:

The application features separate registration and login pages for buyers and sellers. Users can create accounts by providing basic information, including username, email, and password.
Upon successful registration, users are redirected to their respective login pages.

2. Role-Based Access:

The platform differentiates between buyers and sellers, ensuring that each user type has access to the features relevant to them.
Sellers can manage their listings, view their sales history, and track performance, while buyers can browse and purchase available products.

3. Listings Management:

Sellers can create, update, and view their listings through a dedicated dashboard. Each listing includes details such as product name, description, price, and quantity.
Buyers can search for products and view listings based on their preferences, making it easy to find what they need.

4. Responsive Design:

The application is designed to be responsive, providing an optimal user experience across various devices, including desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.
The navigation bar remains fixed at the top, ensuring easy access to different sections of the application as users scroll through the homepage.

5. About and Contact Sections:

The application includes sections for "About Us" and "Contact," providing users with information about the platformâ€™s mission and ways to reach out for support.

Benefits:
1. Enhanced Connectivity: FarmLink connects sellers and buyers directly, minimizing intermediaries and allowing for better pricing and accessibility to agricultural products.

2. User-Friendly Interface: The intuitive design makes it easy for users to navigate the platform, register, and manage their listings or purchases without technical expertise.

3. Targeted Marketplace: By catering specifically to agricultural products and services, FarmLink addresses the unique needs of the agribusiness sector.

4. Increased Market Reach: Sellers can reach a broader audience, while buyers have access to a wider range of products, promoting agricultural trade growth.

Technologies and Tools Used:
    
    1. HTML/CSS: For structuring and styling the web pages, ensuring a responsive and visually appealing design.

    2. JavaScript: For client-side functionality, including form validation and dynamic interactions within the application.

    3. Node.js and Express: To create a robust back-end server that handles user requests, manages sessions, and communicates with the database.

    4. MySQL: For storing user data, product listings, and transactions, providing a flexible and scalable database solution.

    5. Git: For version control, enabling efficient collaboration and code management throughout the development process.
